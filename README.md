# codecademy-random-words-Portfolio Project

##Funky Fortunes

The purpose of this project is to showcase what I have learned about basic Javascript syntax.
This is the first portfolio project in the Full Stack Engineer Track on Codecademy. 

This project is a simple random phrase generator that generates a random "Funky Fortune" when the user runs it.

The first iteration of this project will simply be the Javascript that makes it work, at a later time I will come back and style it with HTML and CSS.
